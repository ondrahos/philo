## Philosophers Project Summary

### Project Overview

The Philosophers project is a crucial part of the curriculum at 42 School, designed to explore synchronization problems and concurrent programming. It challenges students to implement the dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes.

### Key Objectives

- Implement a solution to the dining philosophers problem, where multiple threads (philosophers) compete for limited resources (forks) without causing deadlock or starvation.
- Utilize synchronization primitives such as mutexes and semaphores to coordinate the actions of multiple threads.
- Gain practical experience in concurrent programming and understand the challenges associated with it.

### Core Features

1. **Dining Philosophers Algorithm:**
   - Implementation of the dining philosophers problem, where philosophers alternate between thinking and eating while avoiding deadlock and starvation.

2. **Thread Management:**
   - Creation and management of multiple threads representing philosophers, each with its own state and behavior.

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Proper management of shared resources (forks) to prevent conflicts and ensure mutual exclusion.

4. **Synchronization:**
   - Use of synchronization primitives such as mutexes or semaphores to control access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.

### Input Format

The program should accept command-line arguments specifying the number of philosophers and the time each philosopher spends thinking and eating. For example:
- `<number_of_philosophers>`: The total number of philosophers at the table.
- `<time_to_die>`: Time in milliseconds after which a philosopher dies if they have not started eating.
- `<time_to_eat>`: Time in milliseconds that a philosopher takes to finish eating.
- `<time_to_sleep>`: Time in milliseconds that a philosopher spends sleeping before starting the next cycle.

### Benefits

- Develops a deep understanding of synchronization problems and concurrent programming concepts.
- Improves problem-solving skills by tackling a classic concurrency problem.
- Enhances proficiency in using threading libraries and synchronization mechanisms.

### Conclusion

The Philosophers project offers students an opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of concurrent programming and synchronization problems. By successfully implementing a solution to the dining philosophers problem, students gain invaluable experience that prepares them for tackling real-world challenges in software development.
